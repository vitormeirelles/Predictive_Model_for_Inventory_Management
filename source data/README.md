All datasets were ingested and transformed within the Microsoft Fabric environment using the Lakehouse architecture. Data was processed through the following layers:

- **Projeto_II_Bronze_** – Raw data converted to Delta format
- **Projeto_II_Silver_** – Cleaned and normalized datasets
- **Projeto_II_Gold_** – Star schema modeling with dimension and fact tables
- **ML_Area_** – Final feature table used for machine learning modeling
- **Power BI**: Visualization of results and reporting

Access to this data requires membership in the Fabric workspace used during project development.
